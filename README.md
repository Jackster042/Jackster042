# Hi, I'm Nemanja 👋

### Software Engineer | Serbia (GMT+1)

I am focused on building products where **high-performance AI meets intentional design**. 

I leverage generative AI to orchestrate sophisticated user experiences—like real-time voice tutors and intelligent data engines—while maintaining a strong, opinionated stance on the core fundamentals of programming. I believe that while AI is a powerful assistant, it is no substitute for **clean architecture, type safety, and efficient code.**

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Philosophy
- **Frontend:** React 19, Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Node.js, tRPC, Inngest (Background Jobs).
- **Architecture:** I care about clear information architecture and interactions that feel inevitable. My process is lightweight: align on outcomes, prototype quickly, and refine relentlessly.
- **Data:** PostgreSQL (Drizzle), MongoDB, Supabase RLS.

### 🚀 Production-Grade Projects
- **[Elora](https://elora-xzf6.vercel.app/)**: High-concurrency E-commerce with resilient payment pipelines.
- **[Mentora](https://mentora-edu.xyz/)**: AI tutoring platform with sub-second real-time voice synthesis.
- **[Certum AI](https://certumai.xyz/)**: Empathic AI interview SaaS using Hume AI & Gemini.
- **[StockTrail](https://stock-trail-sigma.vercel.app/)**: Fintech tracker processing 50k+ market calls daily.

  ### 🧪 The Laboratory (Active Prototypes)
*"Align on outcomes, prototype quickly, and refine relentlessly."*

I maintain a [Laboratory Repository](https://github.com/Jackster042/lab) as a public roadmap for upcoming systems. Currently exploring:
- **Real Estate Systems (Architecture Pivot):** Migrating from Next.js to **TanStack Start** to implement 100% type-safe routing and granular server-state patterns.
- **Canvas Cameo V2 (System Deconstruction):** Decoupling a "Distributed Monolith" into a truly **Event-Driven Microservices** architecture using message brokers.
- **Next.js 15 & React 19:** Validating the limits of Turbopack and modern rendering logic for low-latency AI orchestration.

*Source code for these experiments is pushed only once it meets my standards for engineering integrity.*

### 🎯 Process
I build tools that respect the user's time and intelligence. My focus is on shipping instrumented, secure, and stress-tested software that delivers measurable value.
